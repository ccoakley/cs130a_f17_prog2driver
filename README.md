# Prog2 driver program

This is designed to test your prog2. Fair warning, it is pretty fragile.

Make a matching inputXXX.txt and outputXXX.txt

Invoke the driver with python3 like so:

python3 driver.py XXX

The input will be processed line by line and fed to prog2. Put a newline when
it is time to wait for output. That empty line won't be sent to prog2. It's
just there to signal to the driver to wait. I have included the test I put on
Piazza. Please make your own.

Note 1: I made the output file support extraneous newlines and comments. this
was because I accidentally tested with an extra space.

Note 2: my prog2 included is dumb and only works on the sample input I provided.
It's a wee bit hardcoded.

Note 3: everything must be in the same directory.
